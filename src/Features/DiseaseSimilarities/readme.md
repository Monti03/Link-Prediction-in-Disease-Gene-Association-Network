File description:
- *write_diseases.ipynb* is used in order to simplify the R code (since no one of us ever wrote in R): this script is used in order to store on a file `diseases.txt` the ids of the diseases in the dataset.
- *get_sim.r* is used in order to get the similarity for each couple of diseases. This script uses this [library](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/meshes.html) that uses the approach defined in this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6463059_A_New_Method_to_Measure_the_Semantic_Similarity_of_GO_Terms)

In order to run the code you have to add the [dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/datasets/10020/10020-DG-Miner.html) in this folder as `DG-Miner_miner-disease-gene.tsv`
