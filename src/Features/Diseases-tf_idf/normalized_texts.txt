 ovarian cancer is a disease that affect woman in this form of cancer certain cell in the ovary become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor the ovary are the female reproductive organ in which egg cell are produced in about 90 percent of case ovarian cancer occurs after age 40 and most case occur after age 60 the most common form of ovarian cancer begin in epithelial cell which are the cell that line the surface and cavity of the body these cancer can arise in the epithelial cell on the surface of the ovary however researcher suggest that many or even most ovarian cancer begin in epithelial cell on the fringe fimbria at the end of one of the fallopian tube and the cancerous cell migrate to the ovary cancer can also begin in epithelial cell that form the lining of the abdomen the peritoneum this form of cancer called primary peritoneal cancer resembles epithelial ovarian cancer in it origin symptom progression and treatment primary peritoneal cancer often spread to the ovary it can also occur even if the ovary have been removed because cancer that begin in the ovary fallopian tube and peritoneum are so similar and spread easily from one of these structure to the others they are often difficult to distinguish these cancer are so closely related that they are generally considered collectively by expert in about 10 percent of case ovarian cancer develops not in epithelial cell but in germ cell which are precursor to egg cell or in hormone producing ovarian cell called granulosa cell in it early stage ovarian cancer usually doe not cause noticeable symptom a the cancer progress sign and symptom can include pain or a feeling of heaviness in the pelvis or lower abdomen bloating feeling full quickly when eating back pain vaginal bleeding between menstrual period or after menopause or change in urinary or bowel habit however these change can occur a part of many different condition having one or more of these symptom doe not mean that a woman ha ovarian cancer in some case cancerous tumor can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other part of the body if ovarian cancer spread cancerous tumor most often appear in the abdominal cavity or on the surface of nearby organ such a the bladder or colon tumor that begin at one site and then spread to other area of the body are called metastatic cancer some ovarian cancer cluster in family these cancer are described a hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutation hereditary ovarian cancer tend to develop earlier in life than non inherited sporadic case because it is often diagnosed at a late stage ovarian cancer can be difficult to treat it lead to the death of about 14 000 woman annually in the united state more than any other gynecological cancer however when it is diagnosed and treated early the 5 year survival rate is high from ghr

 charcot marie tooth disease type 4a cmt4a is a severe early onset form of demyelinating charcot marie tooth peripheral sensorimotor polyneuropathy with manifestation of severe motor retardation and progressive scoliosis considered the most frequent of all autosomal recessive form of cmt onset usually occurs in infancy with distal muscle weakness and foot atrophy followed by proximal involvement and then distal weakness in the upper extremity and atrophy of the hand vocal cord paresis may also occur cmt4a is caused by mutation in the gdap1 gene 8q13 3 encoding a protein required for mitochondrial fission transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner from snomedct_us
 charcot marie tooth disease encompasses a group of disorder called hereditary sensory and motor neuropathy that damage the peripheral nerve peripheral nerve connect the brain and spinal cord to muscle and to sensory cell that detect sensation such a touch pain heat and sound damage to the peripheral nerve that worsens over time can result in alteration or loss of sensation and wasting atrophy of muscle in the foot leg and hand charcot marie tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood symptom of charcot marie tooth disease vary in severity and age of onset even among member of the same family some people never realize they have the disorder because their symptom are so mild but most have a moderate amount of physical disability a small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problem which in very rare case can be life threatening in most affected individual however charcot marie tooth disease doe not affect life expectancy typically the earliest symptom of charcot marie tooth disease result from muscle atrophy in the foot affected individual may have foot abnormality such a high arch pe cavus flat foot pe planus or curled toe hammer toe they often have difficulty flexing the foot or walking on the heel of the foot these difficulty may cause a higher than normal step steppage gait and increase the risk of ankle injury and tripping a the disease worsens muscle in the lower leg usually weaken but leg and foot problem rarely require the use of a wheelchair affected individual may also develop weakness in the hand causing difficulty with daily activity such a writing fastening button and turning doorknob people with charcot marie tooth disease typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch heat and cold in the foot and lower leg but occasionally feel aching or burning sensation in rare case affected individual have loss of vision or gradual hearing loss that sometimes lead to deafness there are several type of charcot marie tooth disease which are differentiated by their effect on nerve cell and pattern of inheritance type 1 cmt1 is characterized by abnormality in myelin the fatty substance that cover nerve cell protecting them and helping to transmit nerve impulse these abnormality slow the transmission of nerve impulse and can affect the health of the nerve fiber type 2 cmt2 is characterized by abnormality in the fiber or axon that extends from a nerve cell body to muscle or to sense organ these abnormality reduce the strength of the nerve impulse in form of charcot marie tooth disease classified a intermediate type the nerve impulse are both slowed and reduced in strength probably due to abnormality in both myelin and axon type 4 cmt4 is distinguished from the other type by it pattern of inheritance it can affect either the axon or the myelin type x charcot marie tooth disease cmtx is caused by mutation in gene on the x chromosome one of the two sex chromosome within the various type of charcot marie tooth disease subtypes such a cmt1a cmt1b cmt2a cmt4a and cmtx1 indicate different genetic cause sometimes other historical name are used to refer to particular form of charcot marie tooth disease for example roussy levy syndrome is a form of cmt11 with the additional feature of rhythmic shaking tremor dejerine sottas syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe early childhood form of charcot marie tooth disease it is also sometimes called type 3 cmt3 depending on the specific gene that is altered this severe early onset form of the disorder may also be classified a cmt1 or cmt4 cmtx5 is also known a rosenberg chutorian syndrome from ghr

 progressive familial heart block is a genetic condition that alters the normal beating of the heart a normal heartbeat is controlled by electrical signal that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way these signal begin in a specialized cluster of cell called the sinoatrial node the heart 's natural pacemaker located in the heart 's upper chamber the atrium from there a group of cell called the atrioventricular node carry the electrical signal to another cluster of cell called the bundle of his this bundle separate into multiple thin spindle called bundle branch which carry electrical signal into the heart 's lower chamber the ventricle electrical impulse move from the sinoatrial node down to the bundle branch stimulating a normal heartbeat in which the ventricle contract slightly later than the atrium heart block occurs when the electrical signaling is obstructed anywhere from the atrium to the ventricle in people with progressive familial heart block the condition worsens over time early in the disorder the electrical signal are partially blocked but the block eventually becomes complete preventing any signal from passing through the heart partial heart block cause a slow or irregular heartbeat bradycardia or arrhythmia respectively and can lead to the buildup of scar tissue fibrosis in the cell that carry electrical impulse fibrosis contributes to the development of complete heart block resulting in uncoordinated electrical signaling between the atrium and the ventricle and inefficient pumping of blood in the heart complete heart block can cause a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest palpitation shortness of breath fainting syncope or sudden cardiac arrest and death progressive familial heart block can be divided into type i and type ii with type i being further divided into type ia and ib these type differ in where in the heart signaling is interrupted and the genetic cause in type ia and ib the heart block originates in the bundle branch and in type ii the heart block originates in the atrioventricular node the different type of progressive familial heart block have similar sign and symptom most case of heart block are not genetic and are not considered progressive familial heart block the most common cause of heart block is fibrosis of the heart which occurs a a normal process of aging other cause of heart block can include the use of certain medication or an infection of the heart tissue from ghr

 primary ciliary dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infection abnormally positioned internal organ and the inability to have child infertility the sign and symptom of this condition are caused by abnormal cilium and flagellum cilium are microscopic finger like projection that stick out from the surface of cell they are found in the lining of the airway the reproductive system and other organ and tissue flagellum are tail like structure similar to cilium that propel sperm cell forward in the respiratory tract cilium move back and forth in a coordinated way to move mucus towards the throat this movement of mucus help to eliminate fluid bacteria and particle from the lung most baby with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience breathing problem at birth which suggests that cilium play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lung beginning in early childhood affected individual develop frequent respiratory tract infection without properly functioning cilium in the airway bacteria remain in the respiratory tract and cause infection people with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have year round nasal congestion and a chronic cough chronic respiratory tract infection can result in a condition called bronchiectasis which damage the passage called bronchus leading from the windpipe to the lung and can cause life threatening breathing problem some individual with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally placed organ within their chest and abdomen these abnormality arise early in embryonic development when the difference between the left and right side of the body are established about 50 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a mirror image reversal of their internal organ situs inversus totalis for example in these individual the heart is on the right side of the body instead of on the left situs inversus totalis doe not cause any apparent health problem when someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia ha situs inversus totalis they are often said to have kartagener syndrome approximately 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a condition known a heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguus which is characterized by abnormality of the heart liver intestine or spleen these organ may be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned in addition affected individual may lack a spleen asplenia or have multiple spleen polysplenia heterotaxy syndrome result from problem establishing the left and right side of the body during embryonic development the severity of heterotaxy varies widely among affected individual primary ciliary dyskinesia can also lead to infertility vigorous movement of the flagellum are necessary to propel the sperm cell forward to the female egg cell because their sperm do not move properly male with primary ciliary dyskinesia are usually unable to father child infertility occurs in some affected female and is likely due to abnormal cilium in the fallopian tube another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infection otitis medium especially in young child otitis medium can lead to permanent hearing loss if untreated the ear infection are likely related to abnormal cilium within the inner ear rarely individual with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of fluid in the brain hydrocephalus likely due to abnormal cilium in the brain from ghr
 multiple endocrine neoplasia is a group of disorder that affect the body 's network of hormone producing gland called the endocrine system hormone are chemical messenger that travel through the bloodstream and regulate the function of cell and tissue throughout the body multiple endocrine neoplasia typically involves tumor neoplasia in at least two endocrine gland tumor can also develop in other organ and tissue these growth can be noncancerous benign or cancerous malignant if the tumor become cancerous the condition can be life threatening the major form of multiple endocrine neoplasia are called type 1 type 2 and type 4 these type are distinguished by the gene involved the type of hormone made and the characteristic sign and symptom many different type of tumor are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 frequently involves tumor of the parathyroid gland the pituitary gland and the pancreas tumor in these gland can lead to the overproduction of hormone the most common sign of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is overactivity of the parathyroid gland hyperparathyroidism hyperparathyroidism disrupts the normal balance of calcium in the blood which can lead to kidney stone thinning of bone nausea and vomiting high blood pressure hypertension weakness and fatigue the most common sign of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is a form of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma some people with this disorder also develop a pheochromocytoma which is an adrenal gland tumor that can cause dangerously high blood pressure multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is divided into three subtypes type 2a type 2b formerly called type 3 and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma fmtc these subtypes differ in their characteristic sign and symptom and risk of specific tumor for example hyperparathyroidism occurs only in type 2a and medullary thyroid carcinoma is the only feature of fmtc the sign and symptom of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 are relatively consistent within any one family multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 appears to have sign and symptom similar to those of type 1 although it is caused by mutation in a different gene hyperparathyroidism is the most common feature followed by tumor of the pituitary gland additional endocrine gland and other organ from ghr

 primary ciliary dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infection abnormally positioned internal organ and the inability to have child infertility the sign and symptom of this condition are caused by abnormal cilium and flagellum cilium are microscopic finger like projection that stick out from the surface of cell they are found in the lining of the airway the reproductive system and other organ and tissue flagellum are tail like structure similar to cilium that propel sperm cell forward in the respiratory tract cilium move back and forth in a coordinated way to move mucus towards the throat this movement of mucus help to eliminate fluid bacteria and particle from the lung most baby with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience breathing problem at birth which suggests that cilium play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lung beginning in early childhood affected individual develop frequent respiratory tract infection without properly functioning cilium in the airway bacteria remain in the respiratory tract and cause infection people with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have year round nasal congestion and a chronic cough chronic respiratory tract infection can result in a condition called bronchiectasis which damage the passage called bronchus leading from the windpipe to the lung and can cause life threatening breathing problem some individual with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally placed organ within their chest and abdomen these abnormality arise early in embryonic development when the difference between the left and right side of the body are established about 50 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a mirror image reversal of their internal organ situs inversus totalis for example in these individual the heart is on the right side of the body instead of on the left situs inversus totalis doe not cause any apparent health problem when someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia ha situs inversus totalis they are often said to have kartagener syndrome approximately 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a condition known a heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguus which is characterized by abnormality of the heart liver intestine or spleen these organ may be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned in addition affected individual may lack a spleen asplenia or have multiple spleen polysplenia heterotaxy syndrome result from problem establishing the left and right side of the body during embryonic development the severity of heterotaxy varies widely among affected individual primary ciliary dyskinesia can also lead to infertility vigorous movement of the flagellum are necessary to propel the sperm cell forward to the female egg cell because their sperm do not move properly male with primary ciliary dyskinesia are usually unable to father child infertility occurs in some affected female and is likely due to abnormal cilium in the fallopian tube another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infection otitis medium especially in young child otitis medium can lead to permanent hearing loss if untreated the ear infection are likely related to abnormal cilium within the inner ear rarely individual with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of fluid in the brain hydrocephalus likely due to abnormal cilium in the brain from ghr
